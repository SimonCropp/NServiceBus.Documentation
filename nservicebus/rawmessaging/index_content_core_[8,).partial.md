Since version 8 of NServiceBus, the transport infrastructure can be used directly without the need to spin up a full NServiceBus endpoint. This is especially useful when dealing with integrations with 3rd party systems and building message gateways or bridges.


## Configuration

Configuration of the messaging infrastructure is done via the `Initialize` method:

snippet: Configuration


## Sending

The following code sends a message to another endpoint using an `IMessageDispatcher` that is part of the initialized infrastructure:

snippet: Sending


## Receiving

The following code starts the configured receiver (identified by ID `"Primary"`). Each infrastructure object can contain multiple receivers. Each receiver can be started separately. Once stopped, receivers cannot be restarted. If pause-like functionality is needed create a brand new infrastructure object each time.

## Shutting down

snippet: Shutdown

Before shutting down the infrastructure, make sure to stop all the receivers.
